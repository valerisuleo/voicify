# CardComponent README

## Overview
`CardComponent` is a flexible and customizable card component designed for React applications. It supports header and body content, optional borders, and can adjust its height to match container or content size. This component is built to be easily integrated into any part of your application that requires card-based layouts.

## Features
- **Customizable Content:** Allows you to insert any React node into the header and body sections.
- **Border Control:** Option to remove the border for a cleaner look.
- **Height Adjustment:** Can automatically adjust its height to fill the container or fit the content.

## Props
The component accepts the following props to control its appearance and behavior:

- `header`: Object that can include any React node. Intended for card header content.
- `body`: Object that includes `cardTitle`, `cardText`, and any React node as children. Used for the main content of the card.
- `borderless`: Boolean to control the presence of a border around the card. Defaults to `false`.
- `sameHeight`: Boolean to ensure the card fills the height of its container. Defaults to `true`.

## Usage Example

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import CardComponent from './path/to/CardComponent';
import { ICard } from './path/to/interfaces';

const ExampleCard = () => {
    const cardProps: ICard = {
        header: {
            children: <h1>Card Header</h1>,
        },
        body: {
            cardTitle: "Card Title",
            children: <p>Additional content here</p>,
            cardText: "Footer Text",
        },
        borderless: false,
        sameHeight: true,
    };

    return <CardComponent {...cardProps} />;
};

export default ExampleCard;
```

## Customization
- **Styling:** The component's internal styling is based on Tailwind CSS classes. You can modify or extend these classes within the component or by passing additional classes as props if you adjust the component's structure to accept them.
- **Extending Functionality:** To further customize the `CardComponent`, consider adding new props or expanding the `ICard` interface to include additional styling or behavior options.

## Conclusion
`CardComponent` offers a balance between out-of-the-box functionality and customization, making it an ideal choice for projects requiring a clean, reusable card layout. For any modifications or enhancements, you can directly edit the component or extend its interfaces to suit your project's needs.
