### Initialization

When the `HomePage` component mounts:

1. **State Initialization**: Two pieces of state are initialized using the `useState` hook.
   - `cards`: An array to hold photo cards.
   - `categories`: An array to hold categories, each containing its own list of photo cards.

2. **Effect Hook**: The `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array (`[]`) ensures that the following actions are performed only once when the component mounts:
   - Calls `fetchPhotosAndUpdateState` with a limit of `'8'` to fetch photo cards and update the `cards` state.
   - Calls `fetchAndSetCategories` to fetch category information, including a nested list of photo cards for each category, and updates the `categories` state.

### Data Fetching and Transformation

3. **Fetching Photos**: 
   - `fetchPhotos` is an asynchronous function that fetches a limited number of photos from an API. The limit is specified by the function's argument.
   - The fetched photos are then processed by `transformPhotosToCards`, which maps over each photo, adding additional properties needed for the UI (like `isLike`, `countUsers`, etc.) before setting this transformed list into the `cards` state.

4. **Fetching Categories**: 
   - `fetchAndSetCategories` asynchronously prepares category data, where for each category, it also fetches a list of photo cards (using `fetchCategoryCards`, which internally calls `fetchPhotos` and `transformPhotosToCards`), then sets this enriched categories data into the `categories` state.

### Like Feature

5. **Like Interaction**: 
   - The `handleLike` function updates the like status of a photo card. It takes a boolean indicating the new like status and the photo card object, then updates the `cards` state to reflect this change.

### Generating Card Properties

6. **Preparing Card Props**: 
   - `generateCardProps` is a utility function that takes a photo card item (and optionally additional CSS classes) and returns an object containing properties required by the `CardComponent` for rendering. This includes the setup for the `ImageComponent` and `LikeComponent`, along with titles and text.

### Rendering

7. **Rendering Hero Section**: 
   - A `HeroComponent` is displayed at the top of the page, showcasing a large banner with a welcoming message.

8. **Displaying Categories**: 
   - The `mockData` for categories is mapped over to render `ChipsComponent` for each category. This part is static and not dependent on the fetched category data.

9. **Listing Photo Cards**: 
   - The `cards` state is mapped over to render each photo card using the `CardComponent`, with props prepared by `generateCardProps`.

10. **Showing Categories and Their Cards**: 
    - The `categories` state is mapped over to display each category. For each category, its associated list of photo cards is rendered in a similar manner to the general list of photo cards, but with potential additional styling or modifications as needed.

### Summary

- Upon mounting, the component initiates data fetching for both individual photo cards and categories with nested photo cards.
- It processes and transforms this data to fit the UI requirements.
- It provides interactivity through a like feature.
- It renders the UI based on the fetched and processed data, organizing content into a hero section, a list of photo cards, and a set of categories each with its own list of photo cards.
