Welcome to the Voicify frontend take home exercise. Your task is to redesign our home page by following the designs in Figma using NextJs and Tailwind. For the mobile design you can improvise a responsive design which looks good on all screen sizes.

### Requirements:

- Follow the Figma designs as closely as possible
- Add a README that outlines the structure of your solution. Highlight some of the design decisions and tradeoffs that you made. Feel free to include your thoughts on future considerations and improvements
- Commit your final solution to a public Github repository for code review
- Use NextJS and deploy your code to Vercel
- You can use a Mock API to talk to instead of a backend. There are no schema requirements, feel free to invent one of your choosing.

### We will be assessing your solution by:
- How you structure your components
- Do you have tests?
- Your commits - are they atomic, do you iterate on your solution - Your ability to follow the design spec
- Your ability to improvise when designs are not fully clear.
